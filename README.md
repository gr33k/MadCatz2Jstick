MadCatz2Joystick
================
This has been forked from karlvr's code to make a simple change from 8818 to 8838 (you can see the device id via lsusb). This is because there appears to be two versions of the MadCatz controllers (perhaps more).

_MadCatz2Joystick_ exclusively captures the events of the __MadCatz PC USB Wired Stick 8838__ and maps these events to corresponding events on a virtual game pad device.

The MadCatz PC USB Wired Stick 8838 is otherwise known as the Street Fighter IV Arcade Fightstick by Capcom. This software currently only supports the 8838 model
but can probably easily support other models, so raise an issue or hack the source and submit a pull request!

On the Raspberry Pi the joystick is already registered as a device, but it does not appear to be compatible with MAME. _MadCatz2Joystick_ remaps its so that it is
compatible.

_MadCatz2Joystick_ is nearly entirely based on [_Xarcade2Jstick_](https://github.com/petrockblog/Xarcade2Joystick). It is perfect for use with [RetroPie](http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/).

## Usage

Your joystick will already be registered as a joystick device. _MadCatz2Joystick_ registers an additional joystick / gamepad.

Sometimes I have found the that MadCatz stick doesn't work when it is plugged in. It is detected by the OS, but no keypresses register.
In that case, unplug and replug the device.

In MAME, go into the key settings (press TAB) and map the joystick to the appropriate keys.
